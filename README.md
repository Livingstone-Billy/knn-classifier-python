## Introduction

Sentiment analysis involves using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. 
In this project, we create the KNN algorithm based on scikit-learn k-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify movie reviews as positive or negative sentiment based on their content.

## Project Structure

- `train.txt`: Training data containing sentiment labels and movie reviews.
- `test.txt`: Test data containing movie reviews (without sentiment labels).
- `main.py`: Main Python script for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the KNN classifier.
- `README.md`: Project overview, instructions, and usage details.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Livingstone-Billy/knn-classifier-python.git
   cd knn-classifier-python
   ```
## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```
